# Vanilla+ Library: Vanilla Recipe Pack
This is a data pack containing all vanilla recipes for the Universal Crafting Table. It's not considered a module by itself, but an addon for the Custom Crafting module, also serving as a guide for users of this library to add their own custom recipes. If you are an user of the Custom Crafting library, I advise you to not directly merge this data pack to yours, but instead you can tell your data pack's users to download this recipe pack manually if they want to have access to vanilla recipes through the Universal Crafting Table.

## Requirements
- Minecraft 1.16+
- [Vanilla+ Library: Custom Crafting](https://github.com/vanilla-plus-library/custom-crafting)
